In dir "src/" you can find installer of IDE for "Kumir" (Windows, Linux, MacOS).

To rebuild bytecode-file (*.kod) you need to use binary "kumir2-bc" (kumir2-bc.exe), example of use "kumir2-bc main.kum".

After build you get "*.kod" file. To run this bytecode use binary "kumir2-run". You can update your "*.kod" file in dir "service/" and rebuild docker.
